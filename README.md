## Installation
- Download the Latest release
- Unzip/Uncompress into "C:\ImageSuite\ImageViewer" and never move again.

It is important to not move the application or change file names or folder names especially because of file association.

## File Association
There is no easy or automatic method to associate image files with ImageViewer. You have to manually associate each image extension with ImageViewer manually.

### How?
- Right click any image file that is supported by ImageViewer
- "Open With" > "Choose Another App"
- Scroll Down
- Click "More Apps"
- Scroll Down Again
- Click "Look for another app on this PC"
- Select ImageViewer.exe

*Note: After doing this for the first time ImageViewer might show on "Choose Another App" making it possible to omit browsing steps*

*Another Note: See Documentation.htm for more information such as hotkeys and command line arguments that aren't listed here*
