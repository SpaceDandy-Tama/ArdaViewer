# ImageViewer

## Overview
*Tama's ImageViewer* is an extremely lightweight image viewing application completely written in C#.

Latest version 2.4 celebrates the 10th birthday of ImageViewer by giving it a complete make over and tons of new features, leaving this old screenshot for old albums:

v2.4 was a very big update, so much so I actually considered using v3.0 rather than v2.4.

Now, ImageViewer is more capable, stronger, stable and much, much more easy to use.
